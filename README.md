# Essay Analysis and Grading System

Developed an AI-driven automated essay grading system using Generative AI(Gemini) and Python libraries like PyMuPDF and Pillow. The system processes essay PDFs with text and images received from an LMS platform, analyzes the content using tailored prompts, and provides a comprehensive report with grades and detailed feedback through APIs. Implemented stages for grading essays with images, and created a web API using FastAPI for LMS integration.
